The Spring Security Shiro plugin adds some support for using a hybrid approach combining Spring Security and [Shiro|https://shiro.apache.org/]. It currently only supports Shiro ACLs, since Spring Security ACLs are very powerful but can be very cumbersome to use, and the Shiro approach is straightforward and simple.

The majority of the authentication and authorization work is still done by Spring Security. This plugin listens for Spring Security authentication events and uses the Spring Security @Authentication@ instance to build and register a Shiro @Subject@ instance. It also removes the Shiro credentials when you explicitly logout.
